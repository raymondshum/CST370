# CST370 - Design and Analysis of Algorithms

> In this course, students will learn important data structures in computer science and acquire fundamental algorithm design techniques to get the efficient solutions to several computing problems from various disciplines. Topics include the analysis of algorithm efficiency,
hash, heap, graph, tree, sorting and searching, brute force, divide-and-conquer, decrease-andconquer, transform-and-conquer, dynamic programming, and greedy programming.

## _Description_

This repository contains my coursework for CST370. These are weekly
assignments that challenge the student to write solutions (in either
Java or C++) or algorithmic challenges. Each solution is tested against
a set of test cases by running the associated bash script present in each subdirectory. The "Projects" section contains abridged requirements
for each homework assignment.

> Note: HW0 was an ungraded assignment meant to help us gain familiarity
with our environment: AWS Cloud9 on AWS Educate.

### [HW1](https://github.com/raymondshum/CST370/tree/main/hw1)
1.  Write a C++ program (or Java program) called hw1_1.cpp (or hw1_1.java) that reads input numbers 
from a user and displays the closest distance between two numbers among all input numbers.
2. Write a C++ program (or Java program) called hw1_2.cpp (or hw1_2.java) that reads input numbers 
from a user and displays the number(s) that occurs most frequently among all the input numbers.

### [HW2](https://github.com/raymondshum/CST370/tree/main/hw2)
1. Write a program called hw2_1.cpp (or hw2_1.java) that reads two timestamps of two events from a 
user and displays the difference between the two timestamps. For the program, you can assume that each 
timestamp is composed of the hour (0 ~ 23), minute (0 ~ 59), and second (0 ~ 59) format. Your program 
should present the difference from the second event (= second timestamp) to the first event (= first 
timestamp). Note that the second event always happens after the first event and your program should 
display the time difference of the events.
2. Write a C++ program called hw2_2.cpp (or hw2_2.java) that reads a number of elements in a set first. 
Then, your program should read the elements of the set. After that, your program should display all 
possible decimal numbers, corresponding binary numbers, and subsets one by one. For the program, you 
can assume that the number of elements in a set is less than 10.
3. Write a C++ (or Java) program named hw2_3.cpp (or hw2_3.java) which checks if an input string is a 
palindrome or not. In the problem, a palindrome means an alphanumeric string which reads the same front 
to back. For the problem, you should ignore case and remove all non-alphanumeric characters in the input 
string. For example, “Race car”, “I did, did I?”, “7...8 Don't nod 87.” are all palindromes. But 
“CSUMB” is not a palindrome.

### [HW3](https://github.com/raymondshum/CST370/tree/main/hw3)
1. Write a C++ program (or Java program) called hw3_1.cpp (or hw3_1.java) that reads the number of input values from a user. Then, read the input values from the user. After that, your program should display them in the ascending order. When you display the numbers, you have to use a short representation if there are consecutive numbers. For example, if there are three numbers such as 51, 52, and 53 in the input values, you have to display them 51–53 to save space. For the assignment, you can assume that the input values are positive integers and unique (= No duplications in the input numbers).
2. Write a C++ (or Java) program called hw3_2.cpp or (hw3_2.java) that reads an input graph data from a user. Then, it should present a path for the travelling salesman problem (TSP). In the assignment, you can assume that the maximum number of vertices in the input graph is less than or equal to 15.
3. Write a C++ (or Java) program called hw3_3.cpp (or hw3_3.java) that implements the Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm using a stack and a mark array as you learned in the class. 


### [HW4](https://github.com/raymondshum/CST370/tree/main/hw4)
1. Write a C++ (or Java) program called hw4_1.cpp (or hw4_1.java) that reads a number of input values 
and the values themselves. Then, your program should put all negative numbers in front of all positive 
numbers.
2. Write a C++ (or Java) program named hw4_2.cpp (or hw4_2.java) which displays the biggest number 
in an array with n integer numbers using a divide-and-conquer technique.
3. Write a C++ (or Java) program called hw4_3.cpp (or hw4_3.java) that conducts the topological 
sorting based on the Kahn algorithm covered in the lecture. 

### [HW5](https://github.com/raymondshum/CST370/tree/main/hw5)
1. Write a C++ (or Java) program called hw5_1.cpp (or hw5_1.java) to conduct heap operations. 
2. Write a C++ (or Java) program named hw5_2.cpp (or hw5_2.java) that displays the performance of 
two different sorting algorithms (= merge sort and quick sort) on the screen. 
3. Write a C++ (or Java) program called hw5_3.cpp (or hw5_3.java) to simulate the operations of linear 
probing covered in the lecture. 

### [HW6](https://github.com/raymondshum/CST370/tree/main/hw6)
1. Write a C++ (or Java) program called hw6_1.cpp (or hw6_1.java) to collect maximum number of 
coins on an n x m board which was covered in the class.
2. Write a C++ (or Java) program called hw6_2.cpp (or hw6_2.java) that implements the Floyd 
algorithm to display all-pairs shortest paths as we covered in the class.
